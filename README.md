So A few years ago I Found scopes Begging for Help For his Minecraft server on. Aternos...
jk it was and ran decent enough for us to play. So i helped him and we became Friends. you know. Over the time got more people to come to his server and hired more people. This is where i felt Useless and Wanted to leave. but scopes said no. His server grew overtime and was pretty decent. Then he Rebuilt it with a WHOLE FUCKING CASTLE. Overtime he grew out of it and moved to Discord bots. somewhere in october of 2020 He Made Scopes and renamed himself to scoopy (Dont Take that out of context).
Once his bot used embeds he applied for top.gg and got accepted. his bot got attraction. and I kinda Just Dissapeard for 2 years Then Came Back. Today I Came back to him and we became friends once more. 

This project is mainly my Own But he does help From time to time. And is still in this orginaztion i made years ago lol.
